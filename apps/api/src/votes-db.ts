/**
 * Vote-to-kick ballots on the shared `recflare` D1 database.
 *
 * One row per vote cast: who was voted on, in which game session, by whom, and which way.
 * Append-only like the `report` and `warning` tables (see reports-db.ts), so a vote is a
 * record of what happened rather than a tally that gets rewritten — the tally is computed
 * from the rows.
 *
 * The rows outlive the vote. Nothing deletes them when a session ends, and nothing needs to:
 * a ballot is keyed to its `game_session_id`, and instance ids are not reused, so an old
 * session's votes can never be counted into a new one's.
 *
 * The `api` worker owns this schema/migration (migrations/0023_room_vote.sql and
 * 0026_room_vote_init.sql, applied under
 * its own `migrations_table` so it doesn't clash with the other workers' migrations that
 * share the database).
