/**
 * Room keys — a room's own admission tickets.
 *
 * A creator lists a key for their room: a named, priced thing a player can hold to get
 * through a door the room locks. `room_key` is the LISTING — its name, its price, which room
 * it opens — and `room_key_player` is who HOLDS one. Nothing sells a key yet; a key reaches
 * a player by being awarded. The endpoints:
 *  - `POST /api/roomkeys/v1/create` lists one
 *  - `GET  /api/roomkeys/v1/room?roomId=` lists a room's
 *  - `PUT  /api/roomkeys/v1/updateAll` edits one
 *  - `POST /api/roomkeys/v1/awardbulk` awards the caller some
 *  - `GET  /api/storefronts/v1/buyRoomKey` sells the caller one, for tokens
 *  - `POST /api/storefronts/v1/PurchaseRoomKeyWithCurrency` sells one for its room currency
 *  - `POST /api/roomkeys/v1/owns/bulk` says who holds which
 *
 * This worker (`econ`) owns the tables and their migrations — see apps/econ/migrations/0024
 * and 0025.
