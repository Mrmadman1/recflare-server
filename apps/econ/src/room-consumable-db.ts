/**
 * Room consumables — the things a room sells.
 *
 * The other half of a room's economy: `room-currency-db.ts` mints the money ("MySpecialTokens")
 * and hands it out, and this is the shop that takes it back — a Health Potion for 25 tokens,
 * a custom shirt for 500. A consumable is the LISTING: its name, its picture, what it costs
 * and in which of the room's currencies.
 *
 * The endpoints:
 *  - `PUT /api/roomconsumables/v1/roomConsumable` creates one, or edits it when the body
 *    names an existing `RoomConsumableId`
 *  - `GET /api/roomconsumables/v1/roomConsumable/room/{roomId}` lists a room's
 *  - `POST /api/roomconsumables/v1/roomConsumable/awardBulk` gives one to a player
 *  - `PUT /api/roomconsumables/v1/roomconsumable/{id}/purchase/tokens` and `…/purchase/currency`
 *    sell one, in tokens or the listing's room currency
 *
 * `PurchaseCurrencyId` is a `room_currency`, so a room prices its goods in its own money. It
 * is nullable — `Guid?` in the client's model — for a listing that names no currency, and
 * nothing here resolves or validates it yet: a consumable priced in a currency that has since
 * been deleted still lists, at a price nobody can pay.
 *
 * A null `PurchaseCurrencyId` is priced in TOKENS, which the purchase pays to the room's
 * owner; `MaximumCountPerPurchase` caps a purchase's `Quantity` (0 means no cap).
 *
 * This worker (`econ`) owns the tables and their migrations — see apps/econ/migrations/,
 * 0021 (the listings) and 0022 (what players own of them).
